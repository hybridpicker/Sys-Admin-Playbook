What is Linux?
=================

**************************
It is an Operating System
**************************

-> Collection of various **software components** that operates in a computer software to get things done with hardware

***********************
Other Operating Systems
***********************
- Windows
- macOS
- Solaris(now owend by Oracle)
- Other Unix variants (AIX)

*********
UNIX
*********

Build in 70s in Bell Labs (-Bell Labatories)

-> Andrew S. Tanenbaum build on the UNIX Operating System  MINIX

Linus Torvalds read Tanenbaums book , Operating Systems Design and Implementation) and created Operating System based on Tanenbaums book with different architecure. Linus' system was different how it handels device drivers (-> software components that talk directly to hardware and kernel). Torvald also mentioned a movement nown as GNU (-> Richard Stallman) cloned a whole UNIX system. Spirit of every software as to be open. Inspired by this movement he did this same with his own source code.

1000 of contributers help to imporve that system.

Linux is everywehere
********************

- Smartphones
- Desktop Computer
- Home Entertainment System

etc...


======================
Open Source Philosophy
======================

******************
Why is Linux free?
******************

GNU - means GNU's not UNIX

GNU used Linux-Kernel

FSF - Free Software Foundation 

--> Anyone should get the code and could help to improve.

GPL - License -> Code is free to use (GNU GPLv3 -> newest Version)

gcc -> GNU C Compiler (-> GCC -> GNU Compiler Collections)
    Compiler: Translates from one computer language into another

***********
Main Ideas
***********

- Software should be free
- Free from vendor or government lock-in or control
- All aplications should be distributed with the source code

===============================
Distributions
===============================

**********************************
Components of a Linux Distribution
**********************************

- Linux kernel (Heart and Tweeks of Kernel)

- Core utilities (Software Components like: Bash Shell, Network Components, File System Tools.. -> Makeup  the basic system)
- Supplemental Software (like Desktop-Software, Games etc... like GNOME)
- System Services ( Applications that get Software Components together like Network Services, Login Capabilities, Security Services... like SYSTEMD)
- Software Management (Component that remove, update and install Software)

**************************
Common Linux Distributions
**************************

- Slackware
- Debian
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- SUSE
- Ubuntu (based on Debian)
- Fedora (project owend by RedHat)
- openSUSE (open-source variant for SUSE)
- CentOS (rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux)

===============================
Embbed Systems
===============================

Most Popular is -> Android

- developed by Google
- Touchscreen Interface
- Smartphones
- TV

*******************
Linux does Science
*******************

- Wave Glider robots
- NASA Robonaut R2
- Medical devices
