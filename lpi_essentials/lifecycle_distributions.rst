Lifecycle Management
*********************

Linux Distributions go also through a Lifecycle:

Design
======

This is when the goal or purpose of a distribution is identified, features or functions are defined, and roles are assigned. This is also the phase where it is determined what did not work well in the last release and how these problems.

Develop
========

This is where the distribution gets created based on the design from the previous phase. This could be done on via the cathedral development model, where everything is tightly controlled, or it could be done by the bizarre method, where everything is written out in the open and available from the Internet. Testing of the software is often done during this phase as well to try and shake out any bugs thatmay have been found.

Deploy
======

During the deploy phase, the distribution is released to the public. This is where end users install the software in a variety of environments.


Manage
=======

Next is the management phase, where the distribution that was released or deployed takes in bug reports and releases bug fixes and updates based on the bugs that may have been found during the deploy phase. These updates tend to get released much faster than those from commercial software.

Retire
=======

The distributions that are no longer supported become end of life. This means that they will no longer receive updates or fixes as there are newer versions of the distribution that have already been released, and the focus of the developers' time is shifted to those.

*NOTE:* Not all distributions have the same lifecycle.
