Understanding Open Source Software and Licensing
*************************************************

###########
Licensing
###########

- Software is a type of intellectual property.
- A copyright is a legalized right to copy something.
- Berne Convention is an international treaty that requires countries to recognize other countries copyrights.
- Patents are the very idea of a copyrighted work.
- Trademarks - The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source of origin of products or services, so a trademark, properly called, indicates source or servers as a badge of origin. In other words, trademarks serve to identify a particular business as the source of goods or services. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use.
- Commercial Software is software that would be developed with the intent to then sell that software as a profit.
- Share Software is similar to commercial software except in the copyright and legal perspective in that you can typically download this software and, based on an honor system, you can give payment to the author of that software later on.
- Freeware is like shareware but is always available for free.
- Free Software Foundation (FSF), Open Source Initiative (OSI)
- The General Public License (GPL), which is the license used by the Linux Kernel, grants you the right to redistribute the software, including both the source code and its binaries.
- Open Source licenses typically grant you additional rights to software

Free Software Foundation
=========================

In 1985 Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF)

The phrase and idea is that it is “free as in speech, not free as in beer”
3 Freedoms that the FSF states:

- Freedom to use the Software for any purpose
- Freedom to examine the source code and modify it as you see fit
- Freedom to redistribute the software
- Freedom to redistribute your modified software

FSF is ok with selling software for profit, but given the other freedoms
typically this software type is free

########
GNU GPL
########

FSF and GPL often known as GNU GPL. There are 2 versions of this GPL:

Version 2 (GPLv2)
==================

Release 1991
The Linux Kernel itself is released under GPLv2
This is important because it means that the Linux
Kernel can still be used on what is otherwise a
closed source hardware device such as TiVo and
Android devices for example

These devices actually use a restrictive boot process
to prevent unauthorized kernels to boot to them –
this is something that the GPLv3 would not allow

Version 3 (GPLv3)
==================

Intention was to close what is though of loopholes
in GPLv2
Most new software under FSF are being released
under GPLv3
another GPL known as the lesser GPL or simply the LGPL
This is applied to the libraries or Code libraries

(FDL) Free Documentation License
###################################

The Open Source Initiative (OSI)
================================

Founded in 1998 by both Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond
Typically most software falls under the OSI rather than the FSF

Open Source is a development method for software that harnesses the
power of distributed peer review and a very transparent process.
The promise in this method is that the quality is higher, reliability
is higher, more flexible, lower cost, and an end to vendor lock-in
These are the 10 principles that define the OSI; the first three of these are
the most important:
- Permission to derive works
- Respect for source code integrity
- No Discrimination against persons or groups
- No Discrimination against fields of endeavor
- Automatic license distribution
- Lack of restrictions on other software
- Technology Neutrality

Creative Commons
==================

- Creative Commons was founded by Lawrence Lessig
- The creative commons license is one of several public licenses that enable the free distribution of works that are otherwise copyrighted

Further License types:
=======================

- BSD
- MIT
- Apache
- Artistic
- NPL and MPL

============================
 Open Source Business Models
============================

How does business make profit or exist using free software platforms?

Service and Support
===================

- Dual Licensing – two versions of a product; one that is open source and another with features that are not available on the open source license

Multiple Products
=================

While the company might have one open source
product, other products in the line could have paid licensing or even other
product types like manuals

Open Source Drivers
===================

A special case of the preceding one is hardware
vendors, who make money by selling hardware. They might opt to release
drivers, or perhaps even hardware-specific applications, as open source as
way to promote their hardware. Some hardware vendors are reluctant to
release open source drivers for their hardware because in doing so it
actually reveals information about their hardware which some vendors and
reluctant to share.

Bounties
========

Users can drive open source creation by offering to pay for new
software or new features in existing software

Donations
=========

A lot of open source projects accept donations that help fund
their development.

Outside if these business methods a lot of open source projects come out of the
academics, non-for-profit organizations, governments, hobbyists and more.
